              <h4>Founder's Perspective: From Dream to Reality: Building NetNivaran</h4><hr/>
              <p>It all began in the realm of college freedom and newfound friendships at RMC Rourkela, where I discovered my unwavering desire to become an entrepreneur. While pursuing a B.Com. degree, I relished the carefree days and the vibrant energy of campus life. However, the allure of the capital city beckoned, urging me to chase my dreams and pocket some earnings along the way.</p>
              <p>Amidst the hustle and bustle, I found myself at Disha Research, where my attention to detail thrived. I embraced research work with unwavering determination, diving deep into every challenge that came my way. This led me to the National Institute of Sales, where I pursued a PGDBM and grew as a person, equipped with newfound knowledge and self-belief.</p>
              <p>With a white-collar job in mind, I meticulously crafted CVs and embarked on a quest for the perfect opportunity.Clad in a freshly ironed shirt, I began my career at American Express TRS, witnessing not only a change in my hairstyle but also in my professional status. An offer from IndiaCom Directories Ltd. propelled me towards a better address, shaping the trajectory of my career.</p>
              <p>In the midst of the dot-com revolution, I found myself at Rediff.com—an influential milestone that transformed my perspective. There, I learned valuable industry insights and unlearned outdated notions, igniting a fire within me.</p>
              <p>Fast forward to three years after the millennium, and my college dreams resurfaced with a radiant smile. Fueled by passion and determination, I embarked on the path of entrepreneurship, giving birth to NetNivaran—an internet solutions company catering to a global clientele of over 1400 customers.</p>
              <p>NetNivaran is the culmination of my personal voyage—a testament to the lessons learned and the unyielding spirit within.</p>
              <p>The journey of entrepreneurship has been an exhilarating roller coaster ride, filled with ups and downs. Yet, every day I eagerly await the next sunrise, embracing the possibilities it brings.</p>
              <p>Join us on this extraordinary journey of digital transformation. NetNivaran—where dreams become reality and success is nurtured with passion and purpose.</p>
